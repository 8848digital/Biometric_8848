Key Features:

    Biometric Settings Doctype:
        I have created a Biometric Settings Doctype with three checkboxes:
            Employee Checkin
            Attendance
            Attendance Request
        Based on which checkbox is selected, data will be fetched and processed accordingly.

    Manual Fetch Attendance:
        A button named "Manual Fetch Attendance" is provided in the Biometric Settings.
        Along with this, there are "From Date" and "To Date" fields.
        When specific dates are entered, the button fetches data for the selected date range and displays it in the Doctype.
